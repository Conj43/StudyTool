This is an application I made to be similar to quizlet. You can create study sets on it, and save those study sets as .txt files. You can also reopen those files and use different features like flashcards, fill in the blank, multiple choise tests and there is even a 'learn' feature on the flashcards. This learn feature allows you to only quiz yourself on terms you don't know,
so you go through and choose whether you want to keep studying this term or not and then it randomly shuffles the cards and asks you again until you have no cards left. This was made using Java and the Swing library in Java.
